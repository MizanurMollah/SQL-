It looks like you want to retrieve the first value in each partition and use 
it in further calculations or comparisons. In SQL, you can achieve this by using window functions like FIRST_VALUE or by combining window functions with PARTITION BY.

1. Using FIRST_VALUE Function
The FIRST_VALUE function returns the first value in an ordered set of values within a partition.

Syntax:
sql
Copy code
FIRST_VALUE(column_name) OVER (PARTITION BY partition_column ORDER BY order_column)
column_name: The column from which to get the first value.
PARTITION BY partition_column: Divides the result set into partitions, and the 
FIRST_VALUE function operates on each partition independently.
ORDER BY order_column: Defines the order within the partition, based on which the first value is determined.
Example with FIRST_VALUE
Let’s use the same Employees table and retrieve the first Salary value within each Gender partition:

Table: Employees
Name	Gender	Salary
John	Male	1000
Steve	Male	1500
Mark	Male	1200
Sarah	Female	1300
Lucy	Female	1400
Anna	Female	1600
Query: Get First Salary in Each Gender Partition
sql
Copy code
SELECT Name, Gender, Salary, 
       FIRST_VALUE(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Gender ORDER BY Salary) AS FirstSalary
FROM Employees;
Explanation:
FIRST_VALUE(Salary): Retrieves the first salary within each partition.
PARTITION BY Gender: Partitions the data by Gender so that each gender group is handled separately.
ORDER BY Salary: Within each partition, the rows are ordered by Salary, so the first salary is the smallest one.
Output:
Name	Gender	Salary	FirstSalary
John	Male	1000	1000
Mark	Male	1200	1000
Steve	Male	1500	1000
Sarah	Female	1300	1300
Lucy	Female	1400	1300
Anna	Female	1600	1300
2. Using the First Value in Calculations
You can use the FIRST_VALUE result in further calculations. For example, you might want to compare each employee’s salary with the first salary in their gender group.

Query: Calculate the Difference Between Each Employee’s Salary and the First Salary in Their Gender Group
sql
Copy code
SELECT Name, Gender, Salary, 
       FIRST_VALUE(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Gender ORDER BY Salary) AS FirstSalary,
       Salary - FIRST_VALUE(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Gender ORDER BY Salary) AS SalaryDifference
FROM Employees;
Output:
Name	Gender	Salary	FirstSalary	SalaryDifference
John	Male	1000	1000	0
Mark	Male	1200	1000	200
Steve	Male	1500	1000	500
Sarah	Female	1300	1300	0
Lucy	Female	1400	1300	100
Anna	Female	1600	1300	300
Explanation:
Salary - FIRST_VALUE(Salary): This calculates the difference between the current row's Salary and the first salary in the partition.
3. Alternative Approach: Using MIN Instead of FIRST_VALUE
If you are looking for the minimum value in the partition (which, depending on the order, can be the same as the first value), you can use the MIN function in conjunction with PARTITION BY.

Example with MIN
sql
Copy code
SELECT Name, Gender, Salary, 
       MIN(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Gender) AS MinSalary
FROM Employees;
Explanation:
MIN(Salary): Returns the minimum salary within each gender partition.
Output:
Name	Gender	Salary	MinSalary
John	Male	1000	1000
Mark	Male	1200	1000
Steve	Male	1500	1000
Sarah	Female	1300	1300
Lucy	Female	1400	1300
Anna	Female	1600	1300
This approach is useful when you want to use the minimum salary within each partition for further comparisons or calculations.

Conclusion:
FIRST_VALUE allows you to get the first value in an ordered set within each partition.
You can use it for comparisons or calculations, such as finding the difference between the current row’s value and the first value in the partition.
Alternatively, MIN can also be used to get the smallest value in each partition.
