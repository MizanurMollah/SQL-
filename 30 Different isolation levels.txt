QL Server supports different isolation levels that control how transactions
 are managed in terms of locking and concurrency. Here are the key isolation levels:

1. Read Uncommitted
Description: The lowest isolation level. Allows reading uncommitted (dirty) data.

Pros: No locks are placed, which improves performance.

Cons: Dirty reads can occur (you may read changes that are later rolled back).

sql
Copy code
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;
2. Read Committed
Description: Default level in SQL Server. Ensures that only committed data is read.

Pros: No dirty reads.

Cons: Non-repeatable reads can occur (data may change during a transaction).

sql
Copy code
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
3. Repeatable Read
Description: Ensures that if a row is read twice in the same transaction, it will
 remain unchanged. Locks are placed on all rows that are read.

Pros: Prevents non-repeatable reads.

Cons: May cause blocking as locks are held for the duration of the transaction.

sql
Copy code
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
4. Serializable
Description: The highest isolation level. Ensures complete isolation by placing
 range locks on the data, which prevents others from reading, inserting,
 or updating rows in the range.

Pros: Prevents dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.

Cons: Slow performance due to heavy locking.

sql
Copy code
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
5. Snapshot
Description: Data is read as it was at the start of the transaction, providing a
 version of data (read from the past) without locking.

Pros: No locking, no blocking, prevents dirty and non-repeatable reads.

Cons: Increased usage of tempdb to store data snapshots.

sql
Copy code
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SNAPSHOT;
Summary of Issues Addressed by Isolation Levels:
Dirty Reads: Reading uncommitted changes 
(avoided by Read Committed and higher levels).
Non-Repeatable Reads: Data changes between
 reads in a transaction (avoided by Repeatable Read and higher).
Phantom Reads: New rows being added or deleted by 
other transactions during a transaction (avoided by Serializable).
