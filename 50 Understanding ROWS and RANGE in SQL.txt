Understanding ROWS and RANGE in SQL
In SQL, when working with window functions, you often define a 
window frame to determine which rows are included in your calculations. The two primary methods to define this frame are ROWS and RANGE. Here’s a detailed look at each:

1. ROWS
ROWS specifies a physical number of rows to include in the frame, 
based purely on their positions in the result set. It does not consider the values of the rows; rather, it focuses on how many rows to look at.

Syntax
sql
Copy code
ROWS BETWEEN <start> AND <end>
Example Use Cases
Running Total Calculation

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    Name, 
    Salary,
    SUM(Salary) OVER (
        ORDER BY Salary 
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS RunningTotal
FROM Employees;
Description: This query calculates the running total
 of salaries from the beginning of the dataset to the current row.
Average of Current and Next Two Rows

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    Name, 
    Salary,
    AVG(Salary) OVER (
        ORDER BY Salary 
        ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND 2 FOLLOWING
    ) AS AvgNextTwoSalaries
FROM Employees;
Description: This computes the average salary of the 
current row plus the next two rows.
2. RANGE
RANGE specifies a logical range of values to include 
in the frame, allowing for more flexible calculations. It considers the actual values of the rows in the ordering.

Syntax
sql
Copy code
RANGE BETWEEN <start> AND <end>
Example Use Cases
Running Total with Value Consideration

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    Name, 
    Salary,
    SUM(Salary) OVER (
        ORDER BY Salary 
        RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS RunningTotal
FROM Employees;
Description: This query calculates a running total 
of salaries but can include rows with the same salary value as the current row.
Average of Current Row and Higher Salaries

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    Name, 
    Salary,
    AVG(Salary) OVER (
        ORDER BY Salary 
        RANGE BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND 100 FOLLOWING
    ) AS AvgNextSalaryRange
FROM Employees;
Description: This averages the salary of the current row 
and any subsequent rows that are within the specified range of salary (e.g., up to 100 units higher).
Key Differences
Feature	ROWS	RANGE
Focus	Physical row count	Logical value range
Behavior	Counts rows based on their position	Counts rows based on their value
Use Case	When you need a specific number of rows	When calculations depend on row values
Example of Both in a Query
Here’s a combined example illustrating both ROWS and RANGE within the same query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    Name, 
    Salary,
    
    -- Running Total with ROWS
    SUM(Salary) OVER (
        ORDER BY Salary 
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS RunningTotalRows,
    
    -- Running Total with RANGE
    SUM(Salary) OVER (
        ORDER BY Salary 
        RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS RunningTotalRange

FROM 
    Employees
ORDER BY 
    Salary;
Conclusion
In summary, understanding how ROWS and RANGE operate is vital 
for leveraging SQL window functions effectively. While ROWS is 
used for precise row counts, RANGE allows for more flexible 
calculations based on values. Each has its use cases, making 
them powerful tools in data analysis. If you have any further 
questions or need additional examples, feel free to ask!
