Using GROUPING and GROUPING_ID
Now, let's use GROUPING and GROUPING_ID 
with a GROUP BY ROLLUP to see how they work.


-- Using GROUPING and GROUPING_ID with ROLLUP
SELECT 
    Department,
    SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalary,
    GROUPING(Department) AS IsDepartmentGrouped,
    GROUPING_ID(Department) AS GroupingID.
FROM Employee
GROUP BY ROLLUP (Department);
Explanation
GROUP BY ROLLUP (Department):

 This generates subtotals and a grand total for the Department column.
GROUPING(Department): Returns 1 if the Department column is aggregated 
in the result set (i.e., if it's part of a subtotal or total row), and 0 otherwise.
GROUPING_ID(Department): Returns a unique identifier (in binary format) 
that indicates which columns were aggregated. For a single column, 
this will be 0 or 1, where 1 means the column is part of a subtotal or total.
