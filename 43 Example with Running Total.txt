Example with Running Total
Let's use the Employee table to demonstrate a running total based on the Salary column.

Table and Data Setup
Assuming the Employee table is already populated with the sample data we inserted earlier:

sql
Copy code
-- Employee table assumed to have columns: EmployeeID, EmployeeName, Department, Salary

-- Query to calculate running total of salaries
SELECT 
    EmployeeID,
    EmployeeName,
    Department,
    Salary,
    SUM(Salary) OVER (ORDER BY EmployeeID) AS RunningTotal
FROM Employee
ORDER BY EmployeeID;
Explanation
SUM(Salary) OVER (ORDER BY EmployeeID): This calculates a running total of the Salary column.
ORDER BY EmployeeID: Specifies the order in which rows are processed to calculate the running total. In this case, it's ordered by EmployeeID.
AS RunningTotal: Assigns an alias to the calculated running total column.
Expected Output
Here's how the output would look for the running total:

EmployeeID	EmployeeName	Department	Salary	RunningTotal
1	Alice	HR	5000	5000
2	Bob	HR	4000	9000
3	Charlie	IT	6000	15000
4	David	IT	6000	21000
5	Eva	Finance	7000	28000
6	Frank	Finance	7000	35000
Using Partitioning
If you want to calculate a running total within each department, you can use the PARTITION BY clause:

sql
Copy code
-- Running total within each Department
SELECT 
    EmployeeID,
    EmployeeName,
    Department,
    Salary,
    SUM(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY EmployeeID) AS RunningTotalByDept
FROM Employee
ORDER BY Department, EmployeeID;
Explanation
PARTITION BY Department: Divides the result set into partitions by Department and calculates the running total within each partition.
ORDER BY EmployeeID: Orders the rows within each partition by EmployeeID for the running total calculation.
Expected Output
The output will display running totals for each department:

EmployeeID	EmployeeName	Department	Salary	RunningTotalByDept
1	Alice	HR	5000	5000
2	Bob	HR	4000	9000
3	Charlie	IT	6000	6000
4	David	IT	6000	12000
5	Eva	Finance	7000	7000
6	Frank	Finance	7000	14000
This allows you to see the cumulative sum of salaries within each department, providing more detailed insights.
