It seems like you're asking about the NTILE function in SQL.

The NTILE function is used to divide rows in a result set into
 a specified number of roughly equal groups. It assigns a unique 
 rank (starting from 1) to each row in a group.

Syntax:
sql
Copy code
NTILE(number_of_buckets) OVER ([PARTITION BY partition_expression] ORDER BY order_expression)
number_of_buckets: This specifies how many groups you want to divide the result set into.
PARTITION BY: Optional. Divides the result set into partitions, and the NTILE function 
is applied to each partition.
ORDER BY: Mandatory. Specifies the order of rows before dividing them into buckets.
Example:
Let's say you have a table called Sales with a column Revenue, and you want to 
divide the rows into 4 groups based on revenue.

sql
Copy code
SELECT Revenue, NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY Revenue DESC) AS RevenueGroup
FROM Sales;
This will divide the rows into 4 groups, with the highest
 revenue rows in group 1, and the lowest revenue rows in group 4.

Hereâ€™s an example using a table to demonstrate 
how the NTILE function works.

Table: Sales
SaleID	Product	Revenue
1	Product A	1000
2	Product B	1500
3	Product C	750
4	Product D	2000
5	Product E	1200
6	Product F	900
Query using NTILE:
We will divide these 6 rows into 3 groups using the NTILE(3) function:

sql
Copy code
SELECT SaleID, Product, Revenue, NTILE(3) OVER (ORDER BY Revenue DESC) AS RevenueGroup
FROM Sales;
Result:
SaleID	Product	Revenue	RevenueGroup
4	Product D	2000	1
2	Product B	1500	1
5	Product E	1200	2
1	Product A	1000	2
6	Product F	900	3
3	Product C	750	3
Explanation:
The NTILE(3) function divides the rows into 3 groups 
based on Revenue, sorted in descending order.
The highest revenues go to RevenueGroup 1, and the
 lowest to RevenueGroup 3.
This allows you to see how the NTILE function 
categorizes the data into buckets based on the ranking of the Revenue.
