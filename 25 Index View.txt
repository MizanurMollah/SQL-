Index View Or Matrialized  view.

    When craete on index On a view then call Index view.
	
	
	What is an index view?
	 or
	 what happens when you craete an Index on a view.
	     A standard or Non-Indexed view, just a stored SQL query. When, We try to
		 retrive data from the view, the data is acutually retrived from the underlying
		 base tables.
		 
		 So, a View is just a vartual table it dose not store any data, by default.
		 
		 However, when you craete an index, on a view, the view gets materialized.
		 this means, the view is now, capable of storing data.
		 
		 In SQL servar, we call them index view and in oracel, Matrialized view.
		 
		 Note:
		 1. The View Should be craeted with SchemaBinding Option.
		 2. If an Aggregate Function in SELECT List, References an
		     expression, and if there is a Possibility for that expression to 
			 Became NULL, Then, a replacement Value should be specified.
		 3. If Group By is specified, the select list contain COUNd_BIG(*) expression
		 4. The Base tables in the view, should be refenced with 2 part time.
		 
		 Syntax: 
		      Create Unique Clusted Index UIX_vWTotalSalesByProduct_Name
			  On vWTotalSalesByProduct(Name).
		
		
		Create View VW_SaleByTheProduct
		with Schemabinding 
		as
		Select ProductName, Sum(isnull((UnitPrice*QuantitySold), 0)) AS TotalSales,
		count_big(*) as TotalTransations from dbo.Sales  a
		Join dbo.tblProductSales b
		On a.SalesID= b.ProductId
		group by ProductName


		Select * from VW_SaleByTheProduct

		Create Unique Clustered Index UIX_VW_SaleByTheProduct
		On VW_SaleByTheProduct(ProductName)
