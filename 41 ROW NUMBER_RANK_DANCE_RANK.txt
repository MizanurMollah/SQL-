Explanation
ROW_NUMBER(): Assigns a unique sequential integer to 
rows within the result set, starting at 1. If there 
are duplicate values in the ordering column(s), 
ROW_NUMBER() will still assign a 
unique number to each row.



RANK(): Similar to ROW_NUMBER(), 
but if there are duplicates in the 
ordering column(s), it assigns the same rank to the
 duplicate values. However, the next rank will be skipped.




DENSE_RANK(): Like RANK(), it assigns
 the same rank to duplicate values but
 doesn't skip ranks for subsequent values.
-- Using ROW_NUMBER()
SELECT 
    EmployeeID,
    EmployeeName,
    Department,
    Salary,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS RowNumber,
	RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS [Rank],
	DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS DenseRank
FROM Employee;


SELECT 
    EmployeeID,
    EmployeeName,
    Department,
    Salary,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS RowNumber
	--RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS Rank
	--DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS DenseRank
FROM Employee;
-- Using RANK()
SELECT 
    EmployeeID,
    EmployeeName,
    Department,
    Salary,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS Rank
FROM Employee;

-- Using DENSE_RANK()
SELECT 
    EmployeeID,
    EmployeeName,
    Department,
    Salary,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS DenseRank
FROM Employee;
