TRY_CONVERT FUNCTION
* It is introduce In sql Server 2012
* Converts a value to the specified data types.
* Returns Null If the provided value cannot be converted
to the specified data type.
* If the requested a conversion that is wxplicily not parmitted
the the TRY_CONVERT fails with an error.

Syntex: TRY_CONVERT(data_type, value, [Style])

Style parametter is optional.
The range of accecptable value is determined by the range data_type

Example: 
 As the string can be converted to INT, The results will be 99
 
 Select TRY_CONVERT (INT, '99') as Results 
 
 Syntax
sql
Copy code
TRY_CONVERT(data_type, expression [, style])
Parameters
data_type: The target data type to which you want to convert the expression. This can be any valid SQL data type (e.g., INT, VARCHAR, DATETIME, etc.).

expression: The value or column to be converted. This is the input you want to transform into the specified data_type.

style (optional): An integer that specifies the style of the conversion. This is mainly used for date and time conversions. For example:

1: mm/dd/yy
101: mm/dd/yyyy
3: dd/mm/yy
103: dd/mm/yyyy
And many others for formatting.
Characteristics
Null Handling: If expression is NULL, TRY_CONVERT returns NULL.
Error Handling: Unlike CONVERT, it does not raise an error when the conversion fails; instead, it returns NULL.
Performance: It has a minimal performance overhead and can be beneficial for data validation.
Examples
Example 1: Basic Usage
sql
Copy code
SELECT TRY_CONVERT(INT, '123') AS ConvertedValue;  -- Returns 123
Example 2: Handling Invalid Input
sql
Copy code
SELECT TRY_CONVERT(INT, 'abc') AS ConvertedValue;  -- Returns NULL
Example 3: Converting to DATETIME
sql
Copy code
SELECT TRY_CONVERT(DATETIME, '2024-12-31') AS ConvertedDate;  -- Returns '2024-12-31 00:00:00.000'
Example 4: Using Style with Date Conversion
sql
Copy code
SELECT TRY_CONVERT(VARCHAR(10), GETDATE(), 101) AS FormattedDate;  -- Returns date in mm/dd/yyyy format
Example 5: Inserting Converted Values into a Table
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE ExampleTable (ID INT, Salary NVARCHAR(50));

INSERT INTO ExampleTable (ID, Salary)
VALUES (1, '1000'), 
       (2, 'invalid');  -- Salary for ID 2 will lead to NULL on conversion

SELECT 
    ID,
    TRY_CONVERT(INT, Salary) AS ConvertedSalary
FROM 
    ExampleTable;
Use Cases
Data Validation: Validate user input before further processing.
Data Migration: Handle legacy systems where data types may not align with expected types.
Flexible Queries: Allow for more adaptable SQL scripts that can handle a range of data types and formats.
Limitations
Data Type Constraints: It cannot convert incompatible data types. For example, trying to convert a string that doesn’t represent a valid number to an INT will return NULL.
No Error Messages: Since it returns NULL instead of an error, debugging conversion issues may require additional checks to understand why a conversion failed.
Not for All Data Types: Some data types, such as XML, cannot be converted with TRY_CONVERT.
Summary
TRY_CONVERT is a useful function in SQL Server for safely converting values between data types, especially in scenarios where data integrity is uncertain. It helps prevent errors in queries and allows for more flexible handling of data, making it an essential tool for SQL developers working with dynamic or user-generated data.

Beautiful SQL Code Example
Here's a well-structured example demonstrating the usage of TRY_CONVERT within a query:

sql
Copy code
-- Create a sample table for demonstration
CREATE TABLE EmployeeData (
    EmployeeID INT,
    Salary NVARCHAR(50)
);

-- Insert sample data, including an invalid salary
INSERT INTO EmployeeData (EmployeeID, Salary)
VALUES 
(1, '2500'),
(2, 'not a number'),
(3, '3200'),
(4, '4500.75'),
(5, 'invalid');

-- Query to safely convert salary to INT using TRY_CONVERT
SELECT 
    EmployeeID,
    Salary,
    TRY_CONVERT(INT, Salary) AS ConvertedSalary,
    CASE 
        WHEN TRY_CONVERT(INT, Salary) IS NOT NULL THEN 'Conversion Successful'
        ELSE 'Conversion Failed'
    END AS ConversionStatus
FROM 
    EmployeeData;
Explanation of the Example:
Table Creation: Creates a sample table named EmployeeData with EmployeeID and Salary.
Data Insertion: Inserts various salary values, including valid and invalid strings.
Query Execution: Uses TRY_CONVERT to convert the Salary from NVARCHAR to INT, and provides a status message indicating whether the conversion was successful or failed.
This structured approach ensures clear visibility into the data processing, helping to handle errors gracefully while providing valuable insights into conversion outcomes.

Certainly! Let’s enhance our understanding of the TRY_CONVERT function by providing a more detailed example that incorporates both the CASE and IIF functions in SQL Server.

Scenario
We have an Employee table containing employee details, including their salaries stored as NVARCHAR. Some salaries may be invalid strings, and we want to check the validity of the salary entries and categorize them accordingly.

Sample Table Creation
Here’s how you can set up the Employee table:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name NVARCHAR(50),
    Salary NVARCHAR(50)
);

-- Inserting sample data
INSERT INTO Employee (EmployeeID, Name, Salary)
VALUES 
(1, 'Alice', '5000'),
(2, 'Bob', 'not a number'),
(3, 'Charlie', '7500.25'),
(4, 'Diana', '10000'),
(5, 'Evan', 'invalid'),
(6, 'Fiona', '8000.50');
Query Example Using TRY_CONVERT, CASE, and IIF
Now we want to create a query that checks the validity of each salary, converts it to an INT, and categorizes the results using both CASE and IIF. Here’s the SQL query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    EmployeeID,
    Name,
    Salary,
    TRY_CONVERT(DECIMAL(10, 2), Salary) AS ConvertedSalary,
    CASE 
        WHEN TRY_CONVERT(DECIMAL(10, 2), Salary) IS NOT NULL THEN 'Valid Salary'
        ELSE 'Invalid Salary'
    END AS SalaryStatus,
    IIF(TRY_CONVERT(DECIMAL(10, 2), Salary) IS NOT NULL, 
        'Salary Conversion Successful', 
        'Salary Conversion Failed') AS ConversionMessage
FROM 
    Employee;
Explanation of the Query
EmployeeID and Name: These columns are selected directly from the Employee table.

ConvertedSalary:

The TRY_CONVERT function attempts to convert the Salary column from NVARCHAR to DECIMAL(10, 2).
If the conversion is successful, the decimal value is returned; otherwise, it returns NULL.
SalaryStatus (Using CASE):

The CASE statement evaluates the result of the TRY_CONVERT function.
If the conversion result is not NULL, it sets SalaryStatus to 'Valid Salary'; otherwise, it sets it to 'Invalid Salary'.
ConversionMessage (Using IIF):

The IIF function provides a quick inline evaluation.
If the conversion is successful (TRY_CONVERT is not NULL), it returns 'Salary Conversion Successful'; otherwise, it returns 'Salary Conversion Failed'.
Result
When you run the query, you would get results similar to this:

EmployeeID	Name	Salary	ConvertedSalary	SalaryStatus	ConversionMessage
1	Alice	5000	5000.00	Valid Salary	Salary Conversion Successful
2	Bob	not a number	NULL	Invalid Salary	Salary Conversion Failed
3	Charlie	7500.25	7500.25	Valid Salary	Salary Conversion Successful
4	Diana	10000	10000.00	Valid Salary	Salary Conversion Successful
5	Evan	invalid	NULL	Invalid Salary	Salary Conversion Failed
6	Fiona	8000.50	8000.50	Valid Salary	Salary Conversion Successful
Summary
In this example:

TRY_CONVERT allows for safe type conversion without throwing errors.
CASE and IIF provide flexible ways to categorize the results based on the conversion outcome.
This structured approach gives a clear overview of which salaries are valid and provides meaningful messages for further processing or debugging.
This technique can significantly enhance data quality checks, especially in scenarios where data formats are inconsistent or user-generated input is involved.
