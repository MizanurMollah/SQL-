			Key Differences Between UNION and UNION ALL
			UNION:
			Removes duplicate rows from the combined result set.
			Performs an implicit DISTINCT operation to eliminate duplicates.
			Generally slower than UNION ALL due to the extra step of removing duplicates.
			UNION ALL:
			Combines all rows from the result sets, including duplicates.
			Faster because it does not perform duplicate elimination.
			Syntax
			Both UNION and UNION ALL follow the same basic syntax:

			sql
			Copy code
			SELECT column1, column2, ...
			FROM table1
			[WHERE condition]
			UNION [ALL]
			SELECT column1, column2, ...
			FROM table2
			[WHERE condition];
			Detailed Explanation
			1. UNION
			Purpose: Combines results from multiple queries and removes duplicate rows from the final result set.
			Usage Consideration: Use UNION when you need a unique list of records from both tables or queries.
			Performance Impact: Slower due to the de-duplication step.
			Example:

			sql
			Copy code
			SELECT name, department FROM employees
			UNION
			SELECT name, department FROM managers;
			Here, UNION will remove any rows that are duplicated in both employees and managers tables.

			2. UNION ALL
			Purpose: Combines results from multiple queries but keeps all rows, including duplicates.
			Usage Consideration: Use UNION ALL when duplicates are acceptable or needed.
			Performance Impact: Faster because it does not perform duplicate elimination.
			Example:

			sql
			Copy code
			SELECT name, department FROM employees
			UNION ALL
			SELECT name, department FROM managers;
			Here, UNION ALL will keep all rows, including duplicates. If an employee and a manager share the same name and department, both rows will be included.

			Example Tables and Data
			Let’s create example tables with data to show how UNION and UNION ALL work:

			sql
			Copy code
			CREATE TABLE employees (
				emp_id INT,
				name VARCHAR(50),
				department VARCHAR(50)
			);

			CREATE TABLE managers (
				mgr_id INT,
				name VARCHAR(50),
				department VARCHAR(50)
			);

			INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, name, department) VALUES
			(1, 'Alice', 'Sales'),
			(2, 'Bob', 'IT'),
			(3, 'Charlie', 'Marketing');

			INSERT INTO managers (mgr_id, name, department) VALUES
			(1, 'Alice', 'Sales'),
			(2, 'David', 'IT');
			Example Queries and Outputs
			Using UNION:

			sql
			Copy code
			SELECT name, department FROM employees
			UNION
			SELECT name, department FROM managers;
			Result:

			markdown
			Copy code
			name      | department
			-----------------------
			Alice     | Sales
			Bob       | IT
			Charlie   | Marketing
			David     | IT
			Note: Alice appears only once even though she is present in both employees and managers.
			Using UNION ALL:

			sql
			Copy code
			SELECT name, department FROM employees
			UNION ALL
			SELECT name, department FROM managers;
			Result:

			markdown
			Copy code
			name      | department
			-----------------------
			Alice     | Sales
			Bob       | IT
			Charlie   | Marketing
			Alice     | Sales
			David     | IT
			Note: Alice appears twice because UNION ALL includes all duplicates.
			Comparison Table: UNION vs UNION ALL
			Aspect	UNION	UNION ALL
			Duplicate Handling	Removes duplicates	Keeps duplicates
			Performance	Slower due to de-duplication	Faster without de-duplication
			Use Case	When unique values are needed	When all records are needed
			Typical Applications	Unique lists, reporting	Data aggregation
			Common Use Cases
			UNION:
			Creating unique lists of items from multiple tables (e.g., list of unique clients and partners).
			Used in reporting where duplicate records may skew results.
			UNION ALL:
			Aggregating all data, including duplicates, for analysis.
			Combining tables where duplicates represent meaningful separate instances.
			Performance Considerations
			When to Use UNION:

			When data integrity requires uniqueness.
			Be cautious with UNION on large datasets, as it may slow down query performance.
			When to Use UNION ALL:

			Use UNION ALL when duplicates are acceptable or needed, as it’s more efficient and faster.
			Recommended when working with large datasets if duplicates do not affect the final result.
			Practical Tips
			If you’re only concerned with duplicates in certain columns, consider using DISTINCT within a single query rather than UNION.
			UNION queries can be rewritten using JOIN in certain cases, especially if you’re only looking for values that are distinct across the tables.
