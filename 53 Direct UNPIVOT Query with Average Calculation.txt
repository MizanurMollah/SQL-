        ) AS UnpivotedTable
    ) AS SourceTable
GROUP BY 
    Country;
Explanation
Inner Subquery:

Performs the UNPIVOT operation on tblSales to transform the country columns into rows.
Outputs two columns: SalesAmount and Country.
Outer Query:

Selects the Country and calculates the average of SalesAmount.
Groups the results by Country to compute the average for each country.
Final Result
This query will produce the average sales amount for each country, similar to the previous example but without using a CTE.

Country	AverageSales
Argentina	1000
Australia	800
Brazil	600
Canada	900
...	...
Conclusion
Using a subquery allows you to keep everything in a single query without defining a CTE. If you have further questions or need more modifications, feel free to ask!

Certainly! Below is a beautifully structured SQL code example demonstrating both PIVOT and UNPIVOT operations, along with detailed explanations for each.

Example Scenario
Assume we have a table named tblSales that stores sales data for different countries over a certain period. The structure of the table is as follows:

Country	SalesAmount
Argentina	1000
Argentina	1200
Australia	800
Australia	950
Brazil	600
Canada	900
China	1100
France	700
PIVOT Example
The PIVOT operation is used to transform the SalesAmount from rows into columns based on the Country.

SQL Code for PIVOT
sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    SalesPeriod,      -- Assuming we have a period column
    Argentina,
    Australia,
    Brazil,
    Canada,
    China,
    France
FROM 
    (
        SELECT 
            Country,
            SalesAmount,
            SalesPeriod  -- This is a hypothetical period column for the example
        FROM 
            tblSales
    ) AS SourceTable
PIVOT 
(
    SUM(SalesAmount) FOR Country IN 
    (
        Argentina,
        Australia,
        Brazil,
        Canada,
        China,
        France
    )
) AS PivotTable;
Explanation of PIVOT
Inner Query (SourceTable):

Retrieves Country, SalesAmount, and a hypothetical SalesPeriod from tblSales.
PIVOT Clause:

SUM(SalesAmount): Specifies that we want to aggregate the sales amounts.
FOR Country IN (...): Lists the countries for which we want to create columns.
Outer Query:

Selects the sales amounts for each country as separate columns.
Expected Result of PIVOT
Assuming each country has sales data for the same periods, the result may look like this:

SalesPeriod	Argentina	Australia	Brazil	Canada	China	France
2023-Q1	1000	800	600	900	1100	700
2023-Q2	1200	950	NULL	NULL	NULL	NULL
UNPIVOT Example
The UNPIVOT operation is used to transform columns back into rows.

SQL Code for UNPIVOT
sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    SalesPeriod,      -- Assuming we have a period column
    Country,
    SalesAmount
FROM 
    (
        SELECT 
            SalesPeriod,
            Argentina,
            Australia,
            Brazil,
            Canada,
            China,
            France
        FROM 
            SalesPivotTable  -- This represents the output from the PIVOT example
    ) AS PivotedTable
UNPIVOT 
(
    SalesAmount FOR Country IN 
    (
        Argentina,
        Australia,
        Brazil,
        Canada,
        China,
        France
    )
) AS UnpivotedTable;
Explanation of UNPIVOT
Inner Query (PivotedTable):

This represents the result set from the previous PIVOT operation.
UNPIVOT Clause:

SalesAmount: The output column that will hold the sales figures.
FOR Country IN (...): Lists the columns to be converted back into rows.
Outer Query:

Selects SalesPeriod, Country, and SalesAmount to display the unpivoted result.
Expected Result of UNPIVOT
After unpivoting, the result may look like this:

SalesPeriod	Country	SalesAmount
2023-Q1	Argentina	1000
2023-Q1	Australia	800
2023-Q1	Brazil	600
2023-Q1	Canada	900
2023-Q1	China	1100
2023-Q1	France	700
2023-Q2	Argentina	1200
2023-Q2	Australia	950
Conclusion
PIVOT is used to convert row data into columns, allowing for easier analysis of data.
UNPIVOT reverses this process, turning columns back into rows, which can be useful for detailed reporting.
