What is function?
 function is reusable code that performs a specific task and can return a result.
 Function 3 Types:
 1. Scaler Function.
 2. Table valued Fanction.
 3. Multi Statement table-valued function.
 
 1. Scaler Function:
     It is Return single valued return.
	 
	 Syntex:
	  		  SELECT dbo.Function_Name(5, 6) AS Result;

					CREATE FUNCTION Function_Name 
						(
						  @a INT,
						  @b INT
						)
						RETURNS INT
						AS
						BEGIN 
						  DECLARE @c INT;
						  SET @c = @a + @b;
						  RETURN @c;
						END;

 2. Table valued functions
      Table as the return type, instesd of any scalar data type.
	  The function body is not enclose begin and end block
	  The Structure of the table that gets returned, is determined by the 
	  selecr statement with in the function.
	  
	  Syntex:
	  CREATE function Table_value function
	  (
	   @a int
	   )
	   returns
	   as 
	   return
	   Select * from employeeMaster where employessID= @a
 
  3. Multi statement table values functions;
  
			Function Definition: The function MSTV_empMas returns a table variable @t with specific columns (id, firstname, lastname, and salary).
			Populating the Table Variable: The INSERT INTO @t statement adds rows from the EmployeeMaster table to the @t table.
			Querying the Function: Use the WHERE clause in the SELECT statement that calls the function to filter results, rather than within the function itself.


					ALTER FUNCTION MSTV_empMas ()
					RETURNS @t TABLE 
					(
					  id INT,
					  firstname VARCHAR(200),
					  lastname VARCHAR(200),
					  salary INT
					)
					AS 
					BEGIN 
					  INSERT INTO @t 
					  SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Salary 
					  FROM EmployeeMaster;
					  
					  RETURN;
					END;
					
					SELECT * 
					FROM dbo.MSTV_empMas() 
					WHERE id = 1;
					Explanation



  Deterministic Function:
  Always return the same result any time they are called with a specific set of input values
  teand given the same state of the database.
  
  Ex: Squre, sum , avg etc.
  
  Nondeterministic function: May return different each time they are called with a
  specific set of values even if the database state that access remains the same
  
  Example: GetDate() and Currecn_timeStamp.
