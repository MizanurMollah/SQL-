SQL LAST_VALUE Function
The LAST_VALUE function retrieves the last value in an ordered set of 
rows within a specified window. This is particularly useful for data analysis, 
where understanding the last occurrence of a value is crucial.

Syntax
sql
Copy code
LAST_VALUE(column_name) OVER (
    [PARTITION BY partition_column]
    ORDER BY order_column
    [ROWS | RANGE frame_clause]
)
Parameters
column_name: The target column from which to extract the last value.
PARTITION BY partition_column: (Optional) Divides the result set into partitions.
 The LAST_VALUE function operates independently within each partition.
ORDER BY order_column: Specifies the order in which the rows are processed within the window.
ROWS | RANGE frame_clause: Defines the window frame, which can be set to include s
pecific rows or a logical range of values.
Example: Retrieve Last Salary by Gender
Let’s illustrate the LAST_VALUE function using an Employees table. We want to 
find the last salary within each gender group.

Sample Data: Employees Table
Name	Gender	Salary
John	Male	1000
Mark	Male	1200
Steve	Male	1500
Sarah	Female	1300
Lucy	Female	1400
Anna	Female	1600
SQL Query
sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    Name, 
    Gender, 
    Salary, 
    LAST_VALUE(Salary) OVER (
        PARTITION BY Gender 
        ORDER BY Salary 
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING
    ) AS LastSalary
FROM 
    Employees;
Explanation
LAST_VALUE(Salary): Fetches the last salary value within the defined window.
PARTITION BY Gender: Ensures that the last salary is computed separately for each gender category.
ORDER BY Salary: Orders the salaries within each partition to determine the last one.
ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING: Includes all rows in the partition,
 allowing the LAST_VALUE function to capture the true last value.
Result Set
Name	Gender	Salary	LastSalary
John	Male	1000	1500
Mark	Male	1200	1500
Steve	Male	1500	1500
Sarah	Female	1300	1600
Lucy	Female	1400	1600
Anna	Female	1600	1600
Key Takeaways
Consistent Results: The LastSalary column reflects the last salary in each gender partition, 
demonstrating how the LAST_VALUE function works effectively.
Flexible Usage: You can modify the ORDER BY and PARTITION BY clauses to suit various analytical needs.
Conclusion
The LAST_VALUE function is a powerful tool for data analysis in SQL, allowing you to easily 
retrieve the last occurrence of values within specified partitions. Whether you’re working with employee data, sales figures, or other datasets, mastering this function can enhance your data reporting and insights.
