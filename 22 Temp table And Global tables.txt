Diffrence Between Local And Global temporary tables:
  1. Local Temp Tables are prefix with single pound (#) symbal, Where as global temp
  Tables are Prefix with 2 Pound(##) Symbols.
  2. SQL server appends some random numbers at the end of the local temp table name,
  where this is not done for global temp table names.
  3. Local Temporary tables are only visible to that session of the SQL Servar which
  has craeted it. where as the Global tempurary tables are visible to all the SQL servar session.
  4. Local temporary Tables are automatically dropped, when the session that craeted the temporary 
  tables is closed, where as Global temporary tables are distroyed when the last connection that 
  referencing the global temp table is closed.
